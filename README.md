Badr Bourki — Developer Portfolio

Overview

This repository contains a single-page developer portfolio for Badr Bourki. It is designed to present a Junior Web Developer profile optimized for job applications and internships.

Structure

- index.html — Semantic HTML for the landing, about, projects, skills, and contact sections.
- style.css — Responsive, modern styles using CSS variables and grid layout.
- script.js — Vanilla JavaScript for mobile navigation, smooth scrolling, and contact form validation (simulated).

How to use

1. Open `index.html` in a browser.
2. Replace placeholder project links with your real GitHub repositories and live demos.
3. Add `resume.pdf` to the project root and update the header link if desired.
4. To enable real contact form handling, connect the form to a backend or third-party service (Formspree, Netlify Forms, etc.).

Design notes

- Color palette favors professional blue/teal accents on a dark background for a modern, minimal look.
- Layout uses CSS Grid for responsive sections and keeps content readable on mobile, tablet, and desktop.
- Animations are subtle (hover lift on buttons and cards) to keep the experience professional.

Next steps (suggested)

- Hook the contact form to Formspree or Netlify Forms for real submissions.
- Convert to React if you'd like componentization and routing.
- Add project screenshots and more detailed case studies for each project.
